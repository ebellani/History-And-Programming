\section{Introduction}

Almost every school that tries to form creative professionals has an
intense focus in overviewing the history of the field. That is doubly
true in art schools, because one is expected to learn to develop his
own style by studying the style of others. Programming, which could be
seen as an art discipline as much as an engineering one, does not
maintain that tradition. That leads to a lack of an historical
perspective of the discipline methods, points of views and techniques.

A professional without an historical perspective could be compared to
a navigator without a compass. The navigator can move, but hardly
advance towards a goal if not by accident.
