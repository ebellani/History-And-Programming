\section{Ideas}

Here I will approach three of the main ideas that integrated to form
the modern personal computer environment: Graphical user interface,
constructionism, and augmentative systems. \cite{smalltalk:kay_alan__early_history_smalltalk}

This division will at times seem artificial, not only because they
influenced each other, but because there is great overlapping of
techniques and philosophy between them. On the other hand this
structure does capture important distinctions and points of view that
are valuable to understand the whole story.

As with any history, there can be a great level of details, and all of
the ideas presented here have much more intricacies and were
implemented in a great deal of different systems. Most of this fine
grained idiosyncrasies will be left out because of my intention to
give a high level view of the subject. This subject was treated in a
more detailed and authoritative view by the references used here,
which the reader is encouraged to follow.
