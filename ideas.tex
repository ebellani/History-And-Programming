\section{Ideas}

Here I will approach three of the main ideas that integrated to
form the modern personal computer environment: Graphical user
interface, constructionism, and collaborative systems. 

This division will at times seem artificial, not only because they
influenced each other, but because there is great overlapping of
techniques and philosophy between them. On the other hand this
structure does capture important distinctions and points of view that
are valuable to understand the whole story.
