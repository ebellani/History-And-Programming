\section{Conclusion}

A sense of history, even a superficial one, is crucial in any
endeavor, specially so in an endeavor that requires creative thinking
such as programming. As the field looks like it is in constant change
and development the practitioner may have difficulty in judging fads
from advancements, the new from the rehashing of the old. In doing so
he will be less productive and more prone to repeat the mistakes and
not enjoy the advancements of the past.

While the material presented here presents some of the past in the
area of programming and personal computing, it is merely a
glimpse. The programming and technological community needs more focus
and studies on its short history for it to progress with more
diligence and its members be able to make more informed and wise decisions.
